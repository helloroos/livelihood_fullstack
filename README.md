## About the project

Robinhodl is a *nearly* pixel perfect clone of the Robinhood website. The fullstack web app was built over two weeks as part of the App Academy bootcamp curriculum. It's built with Ruby on Rails and Postgres in the backend, and JavaScript/React, Redux, HTML and SCSS in the front. Robinhodl uses real time crypto-currency data from CoinGecko instead of traditional financial assets. 

## Key features

### CRUD

The CRUD paradigm is used to frame user sign up/sign in, buying and selling assets as well as making cash transfers to and from the account.

### Session

Users can sign up or log in using a demo user functionality. 

### Transfers

Users can transfer fake money to and from the Robinhodl account. 

### Orders

Users can make fake purchases and sales of cryptocurrencies.
